Focus Streak is alpha quality software
======================================

Focus Streak is a service & set of tools meant to improve ones ability to cut out distractions and improve focus.
Techies are quite familiar with the cost of context-switching, and it's about time we do something about it.

The Focus Streak service (this repo) is the API for which different Focus Streak compatible clients can interface.
The first client being developed is a Chrome extension: https://github.com/focusstreak/focusstreak-browser-plugins.

This service is quite different from other time-saving/focus apps, as the goal isn't to block distractions - but rather to train oneself to improve.
